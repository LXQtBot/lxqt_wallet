The build system in use is cmake

To build make sure you have the following packages installed(packages may be named differently in your distribution):

g++
gcc
cmake

qt4-devel

Build instructions are below:

mkdir build

To build without KDE/KWALLET support,pass "-DNOKDESUPPORT=true" as one of the arguments at the third stage above

To build without gnome/secret_service support,pass "-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=true" as one of the arguments at the third stage above

The default option if to build for Qt4,to build for Qt5,pass "QT5=true" option at the third stage above.
