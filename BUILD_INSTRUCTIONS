The build system in use is cmake

To build make sure you have the following packages installed(packages may be named differently in your distribution):

g++
gcc
cmake
kde-devel( if you want to build KDE/KWALLET support )
libsecret-devel( if you want to build libsecret support )
qt4-devel or qt5-devel

Build instructions are below:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DQT5=false -DLIB_SUFFIX=default -DNOKDESUPPORT=false -DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false -DBUILD_SHARED=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
make install

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
This options tells the build system the root folder of where to install files.
